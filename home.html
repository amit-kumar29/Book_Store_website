                    Harper Lee, believed to be one of the most influential authors to have ever existed,
                    famously published only a single novel (up until its controversial sequel was published
                    in 2015 just before her death). Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird was published in 1960 and 
                    became an immediate classic of literature. The novel examines racism in the American South
                    through the innocent wide eyes of a clever young girl named Jean Louise (“Scout”) Finch.
                    Its iconic characters, most notably the sympathetic and just lawyer and father Atticus Finch,
                    served as role models and changed perspectives in the United States at a time when tensions
                    regarding race were high. To Kill a Mockingbird earned the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1961 
                    and was made into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962, giving the story and its characters 
                    further life and influence over the American social sphere.

                    F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby is distinguished 
                    as one of the greatest texts for introducing students to 
                    the art of reading literature critically (which means you 
                    may have read it in school). The novel is told from the 
                    perspective of a young man named Nick Carraway who has recently
                    moved to New York City and is befriended by his eccentric nouveau 
                    riche neighbor with mysterious origins, Jay Gatsby. The Great 
                    Gatsby provides an insider’s look into the Jazz Age of the 1920s 
                    in United States history while at the same time critiquing the 
                    idea of the “American Dream.” Perhaps the most-famous aspect of 
                    the novel is its cover art—a piercing face projected onto a dark 
                    blue night sky and lights from a cityscape—an image that is also 
                    found, in a slightly different configuration, within the text 
                    itself as a key symbol.
